## How to install

Go to your unity's root project.\
Under the folder `Packages` open the file `Manifest.json`.\
Add the package and his dependencies to the project :
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "com.lrtools.utility":"https://github.com/Unity-LRTools/Utility.git",
    "com.lrtools.easing":"https://github.com/Unity-LRTools/Easing.git",
    "com.lrtools.smith.statistics":"https://github.com/Unity-LRTools/Smith-Statistics.git",
  }
}
```

## Practical example

When is it beneficial to use Smith-Statistic, and how can it be effectively implemented?

### Using Smith-Statistic in an RPG  

Imagine you're developing an RPG where the player has a health stat. Here's how **Smith-Statistic** can help:  

1. **Creating the Base Statistic**:  
   - Define a statistic named `baseHealth` for the player.  
   - Toggle it as moddable, since it will need to be modified during gameplay.  
   - This statistic will represent the player's maximum health at each level, without any additional modifiers.  
     - **Level 1**: 85 health points.  
     - **Level 60 (max level)**: 1535 health points.  

2. **Adding a Secondary Statistic**:  
   - Create another statistic called `Health`, representing health bonuses from items or equipment.  
   - Mark this statistic as non-modifiable and set its values based on item level. For example:  
     - **Level 1**: Items can provide a bonus of 10 health points.  
     - **Level 315**: Items can provide a bonus of 455 health points.  

3. **Combining Statistics**:  
   - Each piece of equipment the player wears will modify the `baseHealth` by adding the value of its `Health` statistic. This modification is applied using a simple offset system, ensuring the final health reflects both the player's base health and equipment bonuses.  

### Smith-Statistic in a Shooter Rogue-Like  

Let's say you're creating a shooter rogue-like. Here's how you can set up relevant statistics using **Smith-Statistic**:  

1. **Defining Ammo Capacity**:  
   - Create a moddable statistic called `AmmoCapacity`.  
   - This statistic will span from level 1 to level 5, representing an increase from **10 ammo** to **35 ammo**.  
   - It can be modified during gameplay through another statistic called `AmmoBonus`, which is affected by items the player collects.  

2. **Setting Reload Speed**:  
   - Define another statistic named `ReloadSpeed`.  
   - Use only 3 ranks for simplicity:
     - **Level 1**: 2.5 seconds.  
     - **Level 2**: 1.5 seconds.  
     - **Level 3**: 0.5 seconds.  
   - This statistic decreases reload time as the player pick this bonus, improving their efficiency with each rank.  

## Documentation

### Editor window
You can access the editor from the Unity main menu under Smith > Statistic.
The editor allows you to create new statistics, update existing ones, and configure the tool's settings.

### Statistic creation properties
The table below outlines the configurable properties for statistics in the system.

![Create panel](Editor/Pictures/create_panel_filled.png)

| **Property**|**Description**|
|--|------|
| **Statistic ID**| A unique identifier assigned to each statistic. This ID is also used as the class name for the generated property.|
| **Value Type** | Specifies the underlying data type for the statistic. Supported types include `int` and `float`.|
| **Is Moddable**| Indicates whether this statistic supports external modifications. Refer to the **ModStatistic** section for more details.|
| **Statistic Name**| The human-readable name or localization key associated with this statistic.|
| **Growth**| Determines the growth behavior of the statistic, leveraging common easing curves for dynamic scaling.|
| **Max Level**| Specifies the maximum allowable level for the statistic.|
| **Min Value**| Defines the value of the statistic at its minimum level (set to `1`).|
| **Max Value**| Defines the value of the statistic at its maximum level.|
| **Is Clamp**| Enables clamping to restrict the statisticâ€™s value within defined bounds, if modifications are allowed.|
| **Clamp Min**| Specifies the minimum value limit for the statistic when clamping is enabled.|
| **Clamp Max**| Specifies the maximum value limit for the statistic when clamping is enabled.|

### Statistic Drawer
The statistics are displayed in the Inspector, where you can select the level and type of each statistic.\
![Create panel](Editor/Pictures/component_statistic.png)

The type can be inferred from the property name if it matches the class name. For example, if you have a statistic named `Agility` and a property like `public Statistic agility = new Statistic()`, the drawer will automatically recognize that you want to display the Agility statistic and fetch its corresponding range data.\

|`float CountStatistic()`| Count the total number of different statistic in the list.|

## Examples
### Simple usage
An example where we set the level of the statistic then get his value.
```csharp
public void Example() 
{
    Power power = new Power();
    power.Level = 4;
    Debug.Log(power);
}
```
Here we are gonna set all the player statistic to 20% of their actual value.
```csharp
public void Example() 
{
    Player player = new Player();
    foreach(ModStatistic statistic in player.statistics) 
    {
        statistic.RemoveFixedValue(); // Ensure there is no fixed value because they have greater priority over fixed percentage
        statistic.SetFixedPercentage(0.2f); // The statistic base value will be multiply by 0.2 and skip other modifications
    }
}
```
It's also possible using StatisticList<T> to sum value inside the list or have helping method.
```csharp
public void Example() 
{
    StatisticList<ModStatistic> list = new StatisticList<ModStatistic>();
    list.Add(new Power()); // By default it can be 5
    list.Add(new Power());
    list.Add(new Health());
    
    Debug.Log(list.Sum(nameof(Power))); // "10"
    Debug.Log(list.Count); // "3"
    Debug.Log(list.CountStatistic()); // "2", because there only 2 different statistic
}
```

### Save & Load
Here is how to save a `Statistic` and load it again. It goes the same for `ModStatistic`.
```csharp
public void SaveAndLoad() 
{
    Health health = new Health();
    StatisticSave saveData = health.Save(); // return a serializable struct with only serializable field
    // Save this struct somewhere and get it later
    Statistic statistic = StatisticSaveHelper.Load(saveData);
    health = statistic as Health;
}
```
